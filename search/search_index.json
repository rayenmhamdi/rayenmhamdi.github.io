Machine learning(ML) is a set of statistical tools to learn from data. The nucleus of ML is in teaching computers how to learn and make predictions from data without necessarily being programmed. Deep Learning \u00b6 Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which data goes through multiple number of non-linear transformations to obtain an output. \u2018Deep\u2019 refers to many steps in this case. The output of one step is the input for another step, and this is done continuously to get a final output. All these steps are not linear. Seen a photo of a neuron from the human brain? Artificial neural networks are built similarly, with neural nodes connected like a web. Deep learning algorithms require very powerful machines and is very useful in detecting patterns from input data. Data Science \u00b6 Data science has an intersection with artificial intelligence but is not a subset of artificial intelligence. Data science is the study of an aroused curiosity in any given field, the extraction of data from a large source of data related to the question in mind, processing data, analysing and visualising this data, so as to make meaning out of it for IT and business strategies. In simple terms It is understanding and making sense of data. A lot of tools are used in data science. They include statistical tools, probabilistic tools, linear and metric algebra, numerical optimisation and programming.

It is introduced by the researchers at Stanford University, Computer Science Department. The expert systems are the computer applications developed to solve complex problems in a particular domain, at the level of extra-ordinary human intelligence and expertise. Capabilities of Expert Systems \u00b6 The expert systems are capable of: Advising Instructing and assisting human in decision making Demonstrating Deriving a solution Diagnosing Explaining Interpreting input Predicting results Justifying the conclusion Suggesting alternative options to a problem They are incapable of : Substituting human decision makers Possessing human capabilities Producing accurate output for inadequate knowledge base Refining their own knowledge Components of Expert Systems \u00b6 Knowledge Base \u00b6 It contains domain-specific and high-quality knowledge. Knowledge is required to exhibit intelligence. The success of any ES majorly depends upon the collection of highly accurate and precise knowledge. What is Knowledge? \u00b6 The data is collection of facts. The information is organized as data and facts about the task domain. Data, Information , and past experience combined together are termed as knowledge. Components of Knowledge Base \u00b6 The knowledge base of an ES is a store of both, factual and heuristic knowledge. Factual Knowledge : It is the information widely accepted by the Knowledge Engineers and scholars in the task domain. Heuristic Knowledge : It is about practice, accurate judgement, one\u2019s ability of evaluation, and guessing. Knowledge representation \u00b6 It is the method used to organize and formalize the knowledge in the knowledge base. It is in the form of IF-THEN-ELSE rules. Knowledge Acquisition \u00b6 The success of any expert system majorly depends on the quality, completeness, and accuracy of the information stored in the knowledge base. The knowledge base is formed by readings from various experts, scholars, and the Knowledge Engineers. The knowledge engineer is a person with the qualities of empathy, quick learning, and case analyzing skills. He acquires information from subject expert by recording, interviewing, and observing him at work, etc. He then categorizes and organizes the information in a meaningful way, in the form of IF-THEN-ELSE rules, to be used by interference machine. The knowledge engineer also monitors the development of the ES. Inference Engine \u00b6 Use of efficient procedures and rules by the Inference Engine is essential in deducting a correct, flawless solution. In case of knowledge-based ES, the Inference Engine acquires and manipulates the knowledge from the knowledge base to arrive at a particular solution. In case of rule based ES, it: Applies rules repeatedly to the facts, which are obtained from earlier rule application. Adds new knowledge into the knowledge base if required. Resolves rules conflict when multiple rules are applicable to a particular case. To recommend a solution, the Inference Engine uses the following strategies: Forward Chaining or Backward Chaining Forward Chaining \u00b6 It is a strategy of an expert system to answer the question, \u201cWhat can happen next?\u201d Here, the Inference Engine follows the chain of conditions and derivations and finally deduces the outcome. It considers all the facts and rules, and sorts them before concluding to a solution. This strategy is followed for working on conclusion, result, or effect. For example, prediction of share market status as an effect of changes in interest rates. Backward Chaining \u00b6 With this strategy, an expert system finds out the answer to the question, \u201cWhy this happened?\u201d On the basis of what has already happened, the Inference Engine tries to find out which conditions could have happened in the past for this result. This strategy is followed for finding out cause or reason. For example, diagnosis of blood cancer in humans. User Interface \u00b6 User interface provides interaction between user of the ES and the ES itself. It is generally Natural Language Processing so as to be used by the user who is well-versed in the task domain. The user of the ES need not be necessarily an expert in Artificial Intelligence. It explains how the ES has arrived at a particular recommendation. The explanation may appear in the following forms: Natural language displayed on screen. Verbal narrations in natural language. Listing of rule numbers displayed on the screen. The user interface makes it easy to trace the credibility of the deductions.","title":"Expert systems"},{"location":"ai/es/#expert-systems","text":"Expert systems (ES) are one of the prominent research domains of AI.

Machine learning (ML) is a category of an algorithm that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available. Types of Machine Learning \u00b6 Machine learning can be classified into 3 types of algorithms: Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning Overview of Supervised Learning Algorithm \u00b6 In Supervised learning, an AI system is presented with data which is labeled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label. The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data. As shown in the above example, we have initially taken some data and marked them as \u2018Spam\u2019 or \u2018Not Spam\u2019. This labeled data is used by the training supervised model, this data is used to train the model. Once it is trained we can test our model by testing it with some test new mails and checking of the model is able to predict the right output. Types of Supervised learning \u00b6 Classification : A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as \u201cred\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d and \u201cno disease\u201d. Regression : A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as \u201cdollars\u201d or \u201cweight\u201d. Overview of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm \u00b6 In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system\u2019s algorithms act on the data without prior training. The output is dependent upon the coded algorithms. Subjecting a system to unsupervised learning is one way of testing AI. In the above example, we have given some characters to our model which are \u2018Ducks\u2019 and \u2018Not Ducks\u2019. In our training data, we don\u2019t provide any label to the corresponding data. The unsupervised model is able to separate both the characters by looking at the type of data and models the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about it. Types of Unsupervised learning \u00b6 Clustering : A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior. Association : An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y. Overview of Reinforcement Learning \u00b6 A reinforcement learning algorithm, or agent, learns by interacting with its environment. The agent receives rewards by performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. The agent learns without intervention from a human by maximizing its reward and minimizing its penalty. It is a type of dynamic programming that trains algorithms using a system of reward and punishment. In the above example, we can see that the agent is given 2 options i.e. a path with water or a path with fire. A reinforcement algorithm works on reward a system i.e. if the agent uses the fire path then the rewards are subtracted and agent tries to learn that it should avoid the fire path. If it had chosen the water path or the safe path then some points would have been added to the reward points, the agent then would try to learn what path is safe and what path isn\u2019t. It is basically leveraging the rewards obtained, the agent improves its environment knowledge to select the next action.","title":"Machine Learning"},{"location":"ai/ml/#machine-learning","text":"According to Arthur Samuel, Machine Learning algorithms enable the computers to learn from data, and even improve themselves, without being explicitly programmed.
